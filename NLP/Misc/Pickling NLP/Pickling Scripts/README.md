Usage
==========================
[1] Run script 1.
[2] Run script 2.

Script 1 will pickle the algorithms (searilising) to disk. Script 2 then loads these pickled algos into the system and uses them from memory for classification purposes.

**Note that this script was not actually used in the classification of tweets in this project but is here as we had started to think of furture development ideas for this project and this will essentially hugely reduct latency in the classification**
